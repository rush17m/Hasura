My college life isn't that much different to be honest.
Not much has changed except that I am legally allowed to drink and vote and all those other fun things that people tell you about to distract you from the fact that you have entered adulthood and it is no piece of cake. This reminds me of a dialogue from the TV Show F.R.I.E.N.D.S when Monica says "Welcome to the real world. It sucks. You're gonna love it"

Back to my college life. 
I love art more, if that's possible. I maintain an instagram page where I post pictures of some of my art and nail art (Yes, you read that right. I paint on my nails as well). 
I am still an extremely chatty and hyperactive girl.
I still read A LOT. I even bought a kindle because I no longer have the space to store books.
All the other boring stuff like achievements and marks are listed on my resume.

But that is about it on the college front too. 

I hope you enjoyed virtually getting to know me.
I would love to hear back from you. Especially if you had a little fun going through this little document.
