Hey
I don't mean to waste your time but I just wanted you to know that this is probably one of the most fun tasks I have had. Most tests are the standard MCQs and coding questions, and while that makes sense, it also gets mundane after a point. 
This particular test gave me the flexibilty to think and interpret the problem in any fashion I chose and for that, I thank you.

Let us now dive into my school life.
All the noteworthy points from that period of time are listed as follows:
	1. I was a chatterbox
	2. I absolutely love Art
	3. State atheletics champion
	4. Hyperactive
	5. Voracious reader 
	6. And irrelevant details like good at academics, class topper, etc 
	
That is essentially me in a nutshell
